0,"Incredible hike! A little chilly with some brutal wind, but the experience was worthwhile. Be prepared for some serious rock scrambles. My hiking buddy and I were very surprised by the amount of snow still on the top of some of the trails beyond the poplar summit. Made for some challenging conditions on the way to and from the fire tower.",2018-03-17T00:00:00Z,5,10029098
1,"Hard but rewarding. We didn’t even finish this hike just made it shorter by taking shorter way back, because in the beginning of November it was very cold and windy and because of that it was really hard to climb the rocks",2018-03-01T00:00:00Z,5,10029098
2,Some pretty good climbing,2018-02-27T00:00:00Z,5,10029098
3,"Amazing day!  A little tough for the kids, but they loved it.",2018-02-20T00:00:00Z,5,10029098
4,"First time there, won’t be my last!! Pretty hard at the onset. You will be using all 4s to get up the initial ascent. As others have said it gets easier but don’t let easiER get confused with easy. It wasn’t that hard for me but I see the entire loop being a challenge for many. It’s well worth the effort though so take your time and be careful. See you on the trails!!",2018-02-19T00:00:00Z,5,10029098
5,"Great scramble to start, then it eases up. I like doing this in the colder months. Less people.",2018-02-19T00:00:00Z,5,10029098
6,Love this hike❤,,5,10029098
7,"Climb is great but the trail is crowded, littered with bottle caps, glass, and has graffiti in a lot of places that kind of ruins it. Ice makes it very challenging.",2018-01-29T00:00:00Z,3,10029098
8,Scramble is an understatement,2018-01-28T00:00:00Z,5,10029098
9,Fun scramble. Not so fun in the ice... slipped and slided down the red trail but worth the nice view. FYI the trail is still open as of 1/20/18. Apparently some delays on the planned close.,2018-01-21T00:00:00Z,4,10029098
10,"A great hike, very strenuous and technical, especially because of the snowy/icy conditions of the day, but views are breathtaking and well worth the effort. 
Agility and good physical condition are required in the steep portions, but plenty of easy sections to recover in between.",,4,10029098
11,If youre looking for a hell of a work out combined with amazing views this is the spot for you.,,5,10029098
12,One of the best trail hike and rock climb I completed with my son Chris the end of 2017. The views of the Hudson River were amazing. As soon as we hit the summit it started snowing which only made the views more spectacular. Will definitely plan another hike there early this year.,2018-01-14T00:00:00Z,5,10029098
13,Awesome!,2018-01-03T00:00:00Z,4,10029098
14,Hard in a good way. You have to work for it and you get seriously rewarded with fantastic views up and down the mighty Hudson River. Love it.,2017-12-29T00:00:00Z,5,10029098
15,"This was a great, challenging hike.  Plenty of rock scrambling right off the bat.  Tough physical and mental challenge.",2017-10-08T00:00:00Z,5,10029098
16,Great views of the Hudson.,,5,10029098
17,nothing else like it in the area. def the best scramble within two hours of the city,,5,10029098
18,"love it,definitively not like a walk in the park tho!",,5,10029098
19,"Great, fun hike that is easily accessible via public transit from NYC. Lots of scrambling but can get crowded during summer weekends. Good views throughout the trail.",2017-12-10T00:00:00Z,4,10029098
20,"This trail has great views and lookout spots! However, it was extremely packed, so get an early start to avoid the crowds.",,4,10029098
21,"Just the best. Lots of steep scramble, sometimes bordering on bouldering. Great workout. Great adrenaline rush if you climb up some of the steeper rocks (at your own risk) instead of the trail. Views are gorgeous and plentiful. Stunning, challenging, fun. Wear grippy boots. Watch your foot placement when scrambling. Rocks are really slick, even when dry.",2017-11-26T00:00:00Z,5,10029098
22,Love it!!,2017-11-25T00:00:00Z,5,10029098
23,"Be prepared for an early, fairly rapid initial ascent. Plenty of rock scrambling also. The view is definitely worth the effort.",,4,10029098
24,Great trail to take with amazing views!,2017-11-19T00:00:00Z,4,10029098
25,One if the best hikes in the Hudson,2017-11-11T00:00:00Z,5,10029098
26,Finally tackled the ridge known as Breakneck and it did not disappoint in the slightest.  Quite a windy day and I didn’t see anyone else for the first hour or so.  Brutal 1st mile and the windswept leaves that piled up made things a bit tricky to say the least.  I feel extremely fortunate to be able to have had the climb to myself for such along duration.  From what I’ve read and heard it’s quite a popular destination.  I’ve read that doing this hike especially the beginning ascent is good practice for the devils path and if that the case than this I’m sure will be the first of many hikes for me to Breakneck!!!,,5,10029098
27,"Great trail with amazing views. Can get very crowded on weekends, especially when it's fall foliage season",2017-11-05T00:00:00Z,5,10029098
28,"Really challenging, especially at the beginning which takes some real athleticism, but worth it for spectacular views and beautiful rocky forest trail. Super easy to get to from Metro North. Crowded, especially at the beginning, but the crowds thin the farther you go.",2017-11-05T00:00:00Z,5,10029098
29,"My first hike in NY. So the trail is awesome, very hard, very steep, but great overall. Very rocky compared to what I'm used to hiking in GA. HOWEVER, if you want a trail away from it all and away from people, you should probably go during the week. I went on Saturday and it was ridiculously over-crowded. I have never done a hike where I literally had to wait in line for people ahead of me to keep going. Not ideal. So if you enjoy hiking for seclusion and to be in silence and solitude, do not go on a weekend or a popular day/time. Besides that, it was challenging and the views were incredible. Not for out of shape people. Would go again but not on a weekend.",2017-11-05T00:00:00Z,4,10029098
